# Datapacks

This is where you can find all of my datapacks for 1.13 (and above hopefully). more to come

Click on the folder for the pack you want, download the latest version zipfile and enjoy.

## The Missing Sandwich

A Minecraft adventure map involving fun missions, game mechanics, custom sounds, models, textures, etc. This can be used as a map template for those who are just entering into mapmaking.

## Annoying Ghosts

A Minecraft adventure map involving sucking up ghosts with custom-programmed tools in a giant mansion. Players are meant to go on various missions that involve encountering ghosts, playing minigames, etc. The datapack for this map is well-programmed. Again, for those interested in learning how to create detailed Minecraft maps, this works great as well.
